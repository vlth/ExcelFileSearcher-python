# What this project is about
A small hobby python project of mine, which is about being able to search all rows of multiple excel files at once.

# Goals
Of course one of the goals is that the software should do the job. For the UI I wanted to use QT for python and PyCharm as IDE.
Additionally and always important to me, I developed in a test driven and documented way. The documentation mainly contains UML diagrams.

# Requirements

- python
- PyCharm

# Getting started

To get started, install PyCharm and open the project via PyCharm. After the project opened successfully, try run all tests to firstly check if the important testing foundation is fine. Then run the app via PyCharm and have fun :-)
